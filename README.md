# ProjectPulse

**ProjectPulse** (Portal for Unified Learner Monitoring, School Records, and Engagement) is a web-based **QR Code-enabled Integrated Learner Information and School Management System** designed to streamline school operations by centralizing learner information into a single, secure, and role-based platform.

The system automates attendance monitoring, academic record management, health profiling, guidance services, and parent engagement while providing real-time reports that support evidence-based decision-making.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript
- AJAX

### Backend
- PHP 8
- Laravel Framework *(or Native PHP)*

### Database
- MySQL / MariaDB

### Libraries and Tools
- QR Code Generator
- QR Code Scanner
- Chart.js
- DataTables
- SweetAlert2
- Python OpenCV and `face-recognition` (facial attendance)

### Facial Attendance Setup

The face-recognition station is integrated with the ProjectPulse database and
learner records. It does not use the separate `attendance_db` from the source
repository. Learner face registrations are stored as
`assets/images/learners/<12-digit-LRN>.jpg` and attendance is written to the
existing `attendance_records` and `attendance_scan_logs` tables.

1. Install Python 3.11 (recommended by the source attendance project) and the
   scanner dependencies with the same Python executable Apache will use:
   `C:\\Path\\To\\Python311\\python.exe -m pip install -r ai_scanner/requirements.txt`
2. If Apache cannot find Python, set `PROJECTPULSE_FACE_PYTHON` (or the legacy
   `AI_ATTENDANCE_PYTHON`) to the full path of that Python executable and
   restart Apache.
3. In the administrator portal, open **Face Enrollment**, capture a clear
   photo for each learner, then select **Train Face Recognition Model** to
   rebuild the local encoding cache.
4. Open **Face Recognition Station** using an Attendance or Administrator
   account and allow browser camera access.

The recognition model is rebuilt by the training action after enrollment.

For responsive scanning, ProjectPulse starts a localhost recognition worker on
the first facial-attendance scan. The worker keeps the OpenCV detector and
trained model in memory, so subsequent frames do not start Python or reload
the model. It listens only on `127.0.0.1:8765`; set
`PROJECTPULSE_FACE_SERVICE_URL` only when using a different local port.
